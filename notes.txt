HELPFUL NOTES

//setting up global vars for manipulating canvas in 2D
const canvas = document.querySelector("canvas")
const context = canvas.getContext("2d")

//setting up canvas size to window size
canvas.width = window.innerWidth
canvas.height = window.innerHeight

//Image class is part of window 
//creates and sets image for var
const cat = new Image()
cat.src = "./images/TempCat.png"
// ./ refers to parent folder

//js boxes reference position as top left corner of box
this.position = 
{
    x: 200,
    y: canvas.height - 100
}
context.drawRect(this.position.x, this.position.y, 50, 50)

VARIABLE SCOPE
var = function scope 
let = block scope
const = block scope

Properties are part of an object. They dont get declared, they exist after a value gets assigned to them until they are deleted. So actually you don't need to initialize them

function animate()
{
    context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height)

    player.draw()

    requestAnimationFrame(animate)
}
Animation loop necessary when loading images since it takes time
